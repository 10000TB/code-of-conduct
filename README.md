# How to contribute

The Code of Conduct is in a separate file so that it can be pulled into
publications for events and meetups without having to trim this explanatory
text.

To contribute, fork this repo, and submit a PR. We'll review, discuss, and merge
changes as needed. Thank you!

# To Do List:

We'd like to expand the current CoC to include sections for our community channels including forums and IRC, and our meetups.
